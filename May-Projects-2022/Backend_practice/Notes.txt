Understanding the client and server side scripting
Recording - Using Express JS using Mongo DB

1. npm init: - This create a file called package.json which gives description of our project.
Inside package.json file there is main script which contain name of file like "index.js" 
which should be same as the file created. 
2. npm install express
3. node filename

4. res.sendFile: - send a HTML file 


app.use(): - this is written before post or get request 
It is used without a database. 
Using this use function we are trying to do some stuff before we connect to database.
path is also optional in this function like "/app" something
This is a temperory method so we need next parameter
CODE: - 
app.use((req,res,next)=>{
    console.log("App use");
    next();
});
eske just niche jo method hoga get ya post ka voh run ho jayega
app.use() is a middle-ware between Frontend and Backend. 
Yaha par saare middle ware operation perform kar sakte hai 
yaha par database connectivity check kar sakte hai

5. app.get(): - to get data from server for user(client side)
6. app.post(): - to post something or send something to server from frontend 
7. app.patch(): - patch will add to existing value(appending)
8. app.delete(): - 
9. app.put(): - will create a value or replace everything then only add what we are sending in put

Database CONNECTIVITY
1. npm i mongoose
2. go to mongo db-> click on Connect-> connect with application-> copy that code
3. connect with db
4. create schema file: - Schema is blueprint of what you want to store in db
